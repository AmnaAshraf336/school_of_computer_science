Medical   Store Management   System
Medical store management system involves several components such as inventory management, sales tracking, customer management, and reporting. This project may consist of following steps as:-
1.	Requirement Gathering:
o	Understand the needs of the medical store (e. g managing inventory, processing sales, tracking expiry dates, generating reports).
o	Gather requirements through information with stakeholders (store owners, staff) and analysis of existing processes.
2.	System Design:
o	Database Design: Design a database scheme to store information such as products, customers, sales, and suppliers. 
o	User Interface Design:  Design a user friendly interface for easy navigation and operation by store staff.
o	Functional Design: Define the functionalities of the system, including adding new products, updating inventory, processing sales, generating reports. 
3.	Development :
o	Fronted Development: Develop the user interface using a suitable technology( e. g Java  Swing, python  Tkinter, Web-based interface).
o	Backend Development:  Implement the business logic and database interactions using a programming
Language (e .g java, python, C#) and database 
system(e. g MySQL, PostgreSQL ).
4. Testing:
o	Perform unit testing to insure individual components work correctly.
o	 Conduct integration testing to ensure that all modules work together seamlessly.
o	Test the system with real-world scenarios to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
5. Deployment: 
o	Deploy the system in the medical store environment, ensuring compatibility with existing hardware and software.
o	Train store staff on how to use the system effectively.
    
 6. Maintenance and Support:
o	Provide ongoing maintenance and support to address any issues that arise.
o	Periodically update the system to add new feature or improve existing ones based on feedback from user.


Some of the Functional Requirements for Medical Store Management System project should be:

•	Inventory Management: Add, update, and delete products from inventory.
Track stock levels and receive notification for low stock.
•	Sales Management: Process sales transactions, calculate total prices, and update inventory accordingly.
•	Customer Management: Maintain customer records, track purchases, and provide personalized services.
•	Supplier Management: Manage supplier information, track orders, and receive notifications for low stock or expired products.
•	Reporting: Generates reports on sales, inventory levels, best-selling products, etc. , to help with decision-making and analysis.

Now some of the Non-Functional for the Medical Store Management project should be:

•	Security: Ensure the system is secure and protects sensitive data.
•	Scalability: Ensure the system can handle a large number of user and transactions.
•	Performance: Ensure the system responds quickly and efficiently.
•	Usability: Ensure the system is easy to use and navigate.
•	Reliability: Ensure the system is reliable and available 24/7.

   Some of Challenges that could be faced during the projects are:
•	Ensuring data security and privacy.
•	Handling large volumes of data and transactions.
•	Ensuring system scalability and performance.
•	Managing and prioritizing requirements.
•	Ensuring user acceptance and adoption.
•	Handling technical data and legacy code.
•	Ensuring compliance with regulations and standards.
